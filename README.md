# Student-Score-Analysis
Mini Data Analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

# 📊 Student Score Analysis – Mini Data Analysis Project

This project is a beginner-level **data analysis mini-project** using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The dataset contains students' scores in different subjects, and the goal is to perform basic data exploration, transformation, and visualization.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains fictional data of students with their scores in the following subjects:

- 📘 Maths  
- 📗 Physics  
- 💻 Programming  
- 📙 English  

### 📄 Columns
- `Name`
- `Department`
- `Semester`
- `Math`
- `Physics`
- `Programming`
- `English`
- `Attendence`
- `CGPA`

---

## 🧠 Objectives

### ✅ Using **Pandas**
- Load the dataset from a CSV file
- Add a new column `Total` = Math + Physics + Programming + English
- Add a `Grade` column based on Total Score (A, B, C, etc.)
- Find top 5 students based on total marks
- Calculate average score per subject

### ✅ Using **NumPy**
- Create an array of all numerical scores
- Normalize the score array
- Find the subject with the highest average score

### ✅ Using **Matplotlib**
- Bar chart: Total marks of top 5 students
- Line graph: Subject-wise average score
- Pie chart: Grade distribution
- Scatter plot: Maths vs Physics scores
